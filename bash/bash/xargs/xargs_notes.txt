A filter for feeding arguments to a command, and also a tool for assembling the commands
themselves. It breaks a data stream into small enough chunks for filters and commands to process.

Default command for xargs is echo, so these are equivalent:

  $ ls | xargs
  $ ls | xargs echo

NOTE: that xargs processes the arguments passed to it sequentially, one at a time.

Normally, xargs reads from stdin or from a pipe, but it can also be given the output of a file.

example usages:

# remove .txt files older than 30 days
  $ find . -name "*.txt" -mtime +30 | xargs rm
