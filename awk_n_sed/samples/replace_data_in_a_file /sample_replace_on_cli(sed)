# sed can be used on the command line

# method 1 - pipe input into sed
echo "hi there" | sed 's/hi/bye/'

# sed doesn't persist, so to save changes, redirect to a file
echo "hi there" | sed 's/hi/bye/' > test.txt

# by default, just the first occurance found is replaced
# to replace all, add the global (g) flag

echo "hi there hi hi hi" | sed 's/hi/bye/g'
